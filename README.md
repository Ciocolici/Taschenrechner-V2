# Taschenrechner

A C# (CSharp) Windows Forms App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. Just a really basic calculator, able to do basic equations. My first project in Windows Forms, so please don't hate the horrible design and lack of features all calculators have.

*To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch "Taschenrechner V2.exe" located in "bin/Release/net6.0-windows".*
